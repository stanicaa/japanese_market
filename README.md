Using LSTMs to predict next day movements.

The file only contains code snippets for research purposes, and data is not available - as such, the file does not work to be run directly. You need to get/build your own market data first, but yahoo.co.jp is a good source thereof. 

The snippets worked for me, as I have tested them with my data, and I am making the code available for anyone interested in doing more research or testing for their own purposes.
